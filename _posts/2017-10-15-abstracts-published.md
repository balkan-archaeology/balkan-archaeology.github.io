We have published the list of [participants](/participants/) and their
[abstracts](/abstracts/). Please let us know if you would like to
correct your abstract or submit keywords, if you haven't done so
already.

Please send us your slides by the **15th of November**. It would be
best to have your slides be in **PDF format** to ensure that they work
correctly. You can usually obtain a PDF version of your slides by
using an *Export to PDF* or similarly named option. This might be
found under the *File* menu, perhaps under *File > Export*. However,
we will do our best to also accommodate some other common file
types. The computers used for presentations will have either Windows
or Ubuntu running on them.

The locations for the conference can be found [here](/locations/),
along with instructions for reaching the university from the airport
and train and bus stations.
