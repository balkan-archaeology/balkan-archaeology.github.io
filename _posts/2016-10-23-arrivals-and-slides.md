We have received 47 abstracts and they can be found
[here](/abstracts/). Please let us know if you would like to correct
your abstract or submit keywords, if you haven't done so already.

We will attempt to organize parties to greet as many people on arrival
at the airport and train and bus stations as possible. In this regard,
please **send us copies of your tickets to Sofia** or the exact time
and date of your arrival. This is especially important for those of
you arriving after midday on the 17th of November, because we need to
schedule your presentation accordingly. Some of you have already
provided this information. In that case, it isn't necessary to do that
again. We will complete the final schedule when we have all the
arrival information.

We would like to remind you that the time allotted for each
presentation is **20 minutes** and you will be cut off at the end of that
time. Please prepare your slides accordingly and practice presenting
your report within this time constraint.

Please send us your slides by the **15th of November**. It would be
best to have your slides be in **PDF format** to ensure that they work
correctly. You can usually obtain a PDF version of your slides by
using an *Export to PDF* or similarly named option. This might be
found under the *File* menu, perhaps under *File > Export*. However,
we will do our best to also accommodate some other common file
types. The computers used for presentations will have either Windows
or Ubuntu running on them.

The locations for the conference can be found [here](/locations/),
along with instructions for reaching the university from the airport
and train and bus stations.
