Padea-Spahii-Panagiurski kolonii group; North Thrace; Burnished
pottery.  Between 1959 and 1963 four important sites were partly
excavated by Prof. At. Milchev near the villages of Valchedram –
“Pechina mogila” and “Armului”, and Yakimovo – “Gradishteto” and “Nad
Urvata”. All of them provide materials that can be dated in the end of
the Iron Age or the beginning of the Roman period (II/I c. BC – I
c. AD), now kept at Sofia University. The most characteristic of the
sites is the rich collection of burnished gray ware, published and
commented on by Assoc. Prof. L. Vagalinski and later by
Kr. Luka. Besides them they are more finds that can also be dated in
the period II/I c. BC – early I c. AD. The most fascinating site is
Yakimovo-Gradishteto where a coin hoard of Roman denarii (IRRCHBulg
71), hidden after the Actium battle (2 September 31 BC), which was
discovered several years before the excavations of At. Milchev. In the
vicinity of the same modern village (in “Livadeto” location) a
treasure of silver and bronze vessels was discovered in another II-I
c. BC site, at least according to some scholars. It should be noted
that all of this finds correspond well with the written sources about
the first campaign of M. Licinius Crassus. According to Cassius Dio,
when the Romans were following the Bastarnae, they besieged and
stormed a “moesian” rampart, probably somewhere on the left bank of
“Ciabrus” River.

This report aims to gather the current data about the end of the Iron
Age (II/I c. BC – I c. AD) mostly in the region of Tsibritsa
(anc. Cebrus), but some important sites to the east as far as Ogosta
River (anc. Augusta) are also included. The region provides extremely
vigorous data about the time around the Roman conquest and the
establishment of the province Moesia – graves from the so called
“Padea-Spahii-Panagiurski kolonii” group, but mostly pottery from
different sites which were never fully systemized and commented
on. The area around these rivers provides the richest collection of
burnished gray ware from modern Northern Bulgaria. Beside them, other
specific for the period II/I c. BC – I c. AD categories of pottery can
pointed out – hand made vessels with polished surfaces, coarse ware
with specific relief, incised decoration and common gray pottery on
wheel. All of them find many analogies in the Carpathian-Danube area
which might be explained as a phenomenon of stereotypization, caused
by the strong cultural unification and intensive contacts between the
Northern Balkan tribes.
