Depas amphikypellon is one of the most famous vessels in the
archaeology of the Eastern Mediterranean. Due to their distinctive
form and limited chronological distribution, these cups became symbols
of the third phase of the Early Bronze Age. Over the years many
scholars focused their attention on their origin and
circulation. Depata are spread in Northern Syria, Southeastern and
Central Anatolia, Western Anatolia, the Aegean islands and the Balkan
Peninsula and are often considered as solid indicators of contacts and
cultural interaction between them.  So far the most northern region of
their distribution is Upper Thrace. From the discovery of the first
examples in Bulgaria onwards, the depas cups are identified as imports
due to the fact that local Bronze Age pottery is handmade. The
occurrence of handmade depata, together with the wheel-made examples,
is traditionally explained as possible local production and
imitation. In Bulgarian literature they are known as “Trojan cups” and
are perceived as evidence of contacts between Thrace and the
Troad. They played an important role in the periodization of the Early
Bronze Age and the synchronization between Bulgarian and Anatolian
chronology. By mapping the findings and comparative analysis a
reconstruction of distribution network can be suggested that would
enrich our understanding of the relations between the Aegean and the
Balkans in the later Early Bronze Age.
