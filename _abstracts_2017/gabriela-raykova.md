Techniques for making adornments in the Middle Ages Goldmaking has
been a distinct craft industry in Bulgarian cities throughout the
Middle Ages. After XII century began specialization in various
goldsmithing techniques: casting, forging and crushing, filigree and
granulation. Along with them, the decorative work is made of
engraving, awning, enamel, mounting of precious and semi-precious
stones, gilding and casting.  Many of the details of ornaments or
whole jewels have been cast from gold, silver, copper, bronze or
various alloys. Castings are most commonly made of stone and
clay. This well-known technique has been used in many of the
well-researched Bulgarian medieval towns as Veliko Tarnovo, Preslav,
Cherven, Stara Zagora, Pernik and Melnik in its two
varieties. Testimonies for this are the numerous stone molds found for
casting of jewelery. In the first variation, casting was made on a wax
model in clay molds, and the second one used single-sided or
double-sided stone moldings in which the object was negatively shaped.

The purpose of this article is to summarize the finds of medieval
molds from Bulgaria, comment on the ornaments produced by them and to
illustrate this production with artifacts analogous to the models and
details found in the molds.
