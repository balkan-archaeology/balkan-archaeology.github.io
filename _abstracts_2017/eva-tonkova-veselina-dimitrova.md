The present report discusses a small group of imports which has been
found within Bulgarian lands during the last few decades. The so
called net-pattern vessels are mostly represented by ceramic
hemispherical cups which are decorated with network of incised
lines. This type of decoration can also be seen on other shapes, such
as askos or inkwell. The net-pattern bowls are usually made on a wheel
but there are also moldmade bowls and such made from glass and
silver. The group is distributed from the second half of 3rd century
almost to the end of the 2nd century BC in vast territories ranging
from Magna Grаecia to Greece, Asia Minor and the Northern Black Sea
coast. This type of vessels is comparatively rare in principle and so
is the case with the finds from Bulgaria. For now, we know of three
whole examples - two ceramic bowls and one from silver, also a piece
from a glass vessel have been found.

The aim of the study is to analyze these finds coming from the present
day Bulgarian territory which includes the Inner Thrace and also
several ancient Greek colonies on the Black sea coast. Those are two
lands well distinguished from one another but also connected in a
specific symbiosis.
