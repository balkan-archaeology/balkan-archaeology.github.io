Hierocles’s „Synecdemus“ and Procopius of Caesarea’s „De aedeficiis”
are substantial texts for our knowledge in the field of settlement
system and town’s definitions. They are source of very important and,
in the same time, very trustful information for the administrative
order and also for the hierarchical sequence of the town
centers. Unlike „Synecdemus“ by Hierocles, Procopius in his „De
aedeficiis“ makes long description of what imperator Ustinian I has
built. Furthermore he gives a detailed list of restored or newly
erected fortresses and respectively to which province they
belong. Unarguably, one of the most curious aspects of this work is
the „fragmentation“ of Dacia Mediterranea into nine urban(?)
territories (among them four are eponyms of unknown until now town
centers). Last but not least, another important information is the
brief mention of “three small towns”, which lie between Naissus,
Serdica, Pautalia and Germaneia. They are named Remesiana, Kratiskara
and Kumudeva. While Remesiana is identified near the modern town of
Biala Palanka (Serbia) and there are some ideas that Kratiskara has
“inherited” the ancient residency near Kostinbrod (Bulgaria), for
Kuimueva\Kumudeva there are almost no suggestions in the specialized
literature.

The aim of the present paper is to introduce into scientific
discussion the Burdo hill near the modern town of Breznik as a
possible location of one of these unknown centers.
