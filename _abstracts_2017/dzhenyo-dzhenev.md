The current report reviews the data regarding the settlement pattern
along a section of the right Danube bank in present-day Northeastern
Bulgaria in the period from the late 9th century to the mid-11th
century AD. Situated in the western hinterland of the highly important
in political, economic and strategic terms Medieval city of Dristra
(with the limits of present-day Silistra, Bulgaria), the sites in the
focus of this paper have been surveyed and excavated for over a
hundred years now.

Thus, this study aims to comment on several inter-wined problems: what
was the significance of the settlement pattern in the area, developed
in the earlier Medieval period, for the development of the one in the
9th-11th century; the intensity and cause of the process of erecting
forts; to try and evaluate the economic development and significance
of the settlements; to juxtapose the concepts of taking advantage of
the busy European waterway that is the Danube (east-west) and forming
a part of a permanent line of defense (north-south); the effects of
the Byzantine military occupation of the area; whether this settlement
system collapsed or simply transformed in the wake of the invasions of
Nomads and the dire military and economic situation in the 11th
century.
