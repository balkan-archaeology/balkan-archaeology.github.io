In my presentation it will be introduced the rules of games, known
from ancient culture with examples of rules and types of tables for
their playing. Board games are characterized by a large variety of
tables/charts (lat. Ludus) designed to playing them. Astragals are
talus bone of mammals, mostly sheep and goats, but also pigs and
various of cattle, domesticated and wild. The word astragal comes from
the Greek astragaloi (singular astragalos), his Roman counterpart is
tali/talus. Astragals are probably the longest-used objects used to
play, they have been used by many different cultures over the
centuries. Even today, in many countries, people used astragals to
play games, very similar to the ancients. The multiplicity of boards
and astragal games in the ancient world is so great that it is
impossible to present and determine reliably the number of games and
their variants, also can not be excluded that individual regions
characterized by specific games only for them selves. Therefore I will
only touches on some of the most popular games, known from written and
archeolgical sources (boards, pawns, bones and iconography). It should
be noted also that board games were finding mostly in the context of
the public (forums / agora / roads / tavern), which proves their
popularity and socio-cultural character.
