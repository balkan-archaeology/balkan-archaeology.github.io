The items of gold on the territory of the
Kodzhadermen-Gumelnita-Karanovo VI (KGK VI) are characterized with its
rarity. In burial context, they unconditionally possess “exotic
character and origin” and are a mark of prestige. Their discovery in
small or single quantities is an indicator for import from a region
with intense distribution of such items and an existing at that time
metal-working center.

Golden items in graves within the territory of the KGK VI are
discovered in a total of 7 situations (2%) in the necropolises of
Radingrad, Vinitsa, Golyamo Velchevo, Smyadovo and Varašti. In terms
of kind, there are applications, beads and earrings.

In the burial inventory, along with golden items, there are also flat
copper axes, stone hammer axe, which is evidence for the “prestige” of
all three items. The possession of gold is indicator for the
distinguishing of a narrow group of people within the ancient
community of each settlement. In comparison we have to mention that
within the Chalcolithic necropolis of Varna the number of graves with
golden items discovered inside, is 62. Apparently the social
stratification on the territory of the KGK VI in terms of quantity is
on a much lower stage and has a gain-on position.
