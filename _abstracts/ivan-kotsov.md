The Final Chalcholithic covers the time after the end of the classical
stages of late chalcholithic culture complexes
Kodzhadermen-Gumelnitsa-Karanovo VI, Krivodol-Salkuta-Bubani, and
before the beginning of the protobronze cultures. This time is
characterized by a drastic decline of the population in the plain
lands of the Eastern and increment of the settlements in the
semi-mountain and mountain zones of the Central Balkans and the
Rilo-Rhodope area. On the current stage of research, most of the
scholars think that this tendency was due to the climate changes that
occurred in the end of the fifth millennium BC. They led to the
termination of the KGKVI culture complex. KSB culture continued its
existence but with a number of changes in its material culture, which
indicated the transition to the following protobronze cultures. Those
changes were part of complex transformations that probably had been
provoked by the intensive connections between the Aegean, the Balkans
and the Middle Danube.

The main reason for the intensification of the cultural contacts in
this time can be seen in the large-scale exchange of cooper that was
provoked by the metallurgic “boom” in the KSB area. The data for such
contacts is significant. However the South Balkans didn’t take part in
them. On the other hand there are lots of evidence about strong
connections between the last region, the Central Balkans and the
Rilo-Rhodope area. One of common features between them is the increase
in the quantity of the spindle-whorls and the appearance of a new type
– the so called “short conical” spindle-whorls. The appearance of the
new type can’t be explained only with a common stylistic “fashion”,
because the form of the spindle-whorls is directly related to their
function. So, it can be concluded that there were partial changes in
the spinning technique and the spinning process had increased its
economic importance in the whole commented area.

The spinning technique depends on the used materials. Big
spindle-whorls are suitable for spinning of long fiber raw materials
(flax), and the small – for short fiber materials (goat hair,
wool). In comparison with the most of the other Chalcolithic
spindle-whorls the “short conical” can be considered as small.

The increment of the spinning process’s economic importance and the
use of similar to the “short conical” spindle-whorls are also
characteristic features for the mobile stockbreeding Chernavoda I
culture. The existence of mobile pastoral groups in the Chalcolithic
of the Central Balkan cultures was supposed long ago. So, it can be
argued that the occurrence of the “short conical” spindle-whorls
indicates the use of animal fibers in the textile production of those
mobile pastoral groups.

The increment of spinning’s economic importance and the use of animal
fibers in it was a supra-regional process. In the end of the V and in
the IV millennium BC this was a characteristic feature for a wide
region, including the Near East, the Aegean and the Balkans. This
process underlies the selection of the first “wooly” sheep and the
weaving of woolen textile.
