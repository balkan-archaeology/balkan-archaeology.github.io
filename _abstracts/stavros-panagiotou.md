Byzantium and the Arabs, the two great powers in early Medieval times,
continuously fought for thalassocracy in the Eastern Mediterranean
from the 7th until the 11th c AD. During this time special attention
was paid to the strategic lands of Cyprus, Rhodes and
Crete. Arabo-Byzantine relations reached their peak between the
Macedonian and the Abbasid dynasties (9th-10th c.). The two rivals
aimed at supremacy across the Aegean Sea and the Balkan territories
endevouring to create a solid chain of islands as satellites in the
eastern Mediterranean in order to expand their domination and trade in
the Asia Minor as well as in the Middle East. It is worth citing that
both powers sailed in the Aegean having similar purposes and
intentions that is to expand their state and commerce in such crucial,
geopolitical and strategical lands such as Cyprus, Crete and Rhodes.

There are a great number of relevant sources, written mainly in Arabic
and Greek. A careful scrutiny of these sources is needed in order to
understand the various facts of this struggle. Great distortion of
historical events does appear, especially in the Byzantine
sources. Thus, there is an urgent need to evaluate and carefully
construe primary source material and archaeological excavations
setting aside biased and prejudiced misconceptions. Specifically, it
is quite fallacious to accept that the Muslims in Cyprus and Crete
were making atrocities by burning churches and torturing innocent
inhabitants in caves. These facts are quite controversial since the
Christian sources seem to be exaggerated and overestimated as regards
the role and behavior of the Arabs in Cyprus and Crete. In contrast,
it is more acceptable to claim that the Muslims preferred to negotiate
with the local population rather than to open hostilities with
them. Of course, it should be noted that in spite of the continuous
Arab-Byzantine struggle at the sea, there were simultaneously a number
of cultural exchanges especially in Balkan territories.

Archaeological excavations provide significant evidence that the
Muslim settlement in Cyprus and Crete was not such a temporary
piratical assault but an organized embarkation aiming at a permanent
status quo organizing a sustainable naval community in these
regions. It should be noted that naval technology used by both powers
was almost the same. Obviously both powers had extensively used naval
intelligence, a field which needs to be developed. For example, the
main warship, called “dromon” in the Greek sources and “shīni” in
Arabic, was constructed almost identically.

Another important factor that emerged with a lot of similarities was
the utility of spies between Byzantium and Islam in this period. There
are many Byzantine and Arabic sources describing the use of spies
before and during an expedition. For example, Constantine VII
Porphyrogennitus, the Byzantine emperor (10th c.) paid particular
attention to prevent the Muslim spies from the Byzantine boarders
trying also to preserve the chemical compound of the “Greek fire” in
secrecy. However, the “Greek fire”, discovered by the Byzantines,
could not remain a secret weapon of the Byzantines in spite of their
efforts. Archaeological finds and pictorial evidence shed additional
light in order to fill the gap between the Arab-Byzantine struggle in
the Medieval Mediterranean and Balkan territories.
