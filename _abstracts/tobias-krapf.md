A new project for connecting young researchers working on the LBA and
EIA in the Southern Balkans was launched with a two-week workshop in
2015 and continued with a second seminar in 2016. The aim of the
“Balkan Bronze Age Borderland” project is to create a platform for the
exchange of ideas between archaeologists studying similar subjects and
to facilitate interregional comparisons and cooperation.

While the 2015 workshop consisted of a two-week journey from Northern
Greece to Albania, F.Y.R.O.M., Kosovo and SW Bulgaria (28.6. –
11.7.2015), during which the participants presented the sites and the
material they’re studying, the second workshop took place in Kavala
(19.-24.07.2016) with focus on interaction and connectivity during the
LBA and the EIA. Sixteen researchers from eight countries have so far
participated in the project, representing important excavation
programmes, such as Bresto in Bulgaria, Toumba Thessaloniki in Greece,
and Sovjan in Albania. A regional geographic database with coordinates
for the benefit of map production/GIS and a multilingual vocabulary
catalogue covering technical terms are currently in
preparation. Further activities are planned for the coming years and
it is hoped to further expand the group of members interested in this
network.
