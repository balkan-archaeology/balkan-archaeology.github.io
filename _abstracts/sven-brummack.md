Studies of the wide range of chalcolithic burials in the
Kodžadermen-Gumelniţa-Karanovo VI-complexes have always enjoyed a lot
of scholarly attention. The curiosity about the amazing finds from the
nearby Durankulak and Varna cemeteries, have further sparked
interest. Although the PhD study includes a larger scope of interest,
eventually including all cemeteries between the Tisza river and the
Black Sea coast in the period approx. 4800/4750 calBC to 3800/3750
calBC , this lecture will present only a small part of the thesis,
focusing on a comparison of cemeteries in north-eastern Bulgaria and
southern Romania. The similarity of burial types encountered in both,
the Bulgarian Kodžadermen-group and the Romanian Gumelniţa-group, with
the majority of the burials found in contracted position to the east,
have led to attempts to interpret burial practices of these groups
treated as a homogeneous block, and may therefore have marginalized
the extant of regional differences present among these groups.

In order to allow a distinct approach to the question, whether or not
Kodžadermen and Gumelniţa burial sites can be viewed as a homogeneous
group sharing similar conventions in regard to the inequality of
burials, this investigation is set within a stringent theoretical and
methodological framework, based on sociological concepts, employing
analyzing techniques deduced from economical sciences.

Recent sociological works emphasize that the individual´s range of
possible actions are instrumental for the social structure and thus
this “agency “poses a problem for quantification. However, they also
stress that the individual too, is characterized by its socialization
within certain areas of the society in such a way that only limited
ranges of action and thought can be reasonably considered by
them. Therefore, the product of repeated individual´s actions, may
generate a recurring pattern, and thus allows interpretations to be
attempted on distinctive social subareas, among these are the social
institutions governing the burial practices of the
society. Consequently, it may be possible to subject the material
expressions present in the burials to a distribution analysis with the
perspective to explore the depositional patterns, including the
distributional inequality and preference in deposition context.

This approach touches the question of how data are treated in general,
and in particular, how normalization of data is to be
attempted. Because the symbolic value of specific objects represents
an unknown quality to us, this study does not intend to assess objects
with artificial or predetermined values derived from subjective
considerations. Instead, the variances present in plurality, diversity
and exclusivity are utilized; aspects of the archaeological record
which can be readily quantified. Further, a new normalization is
suggested to address specific problems present in the data structure
of burial analysis. The results will finally be subject to a
subsequent inequality analysis to expose regional differences and to
discuss the patterns between different sites using concentration
measures such as Lorenz curves and Gini Indices.
