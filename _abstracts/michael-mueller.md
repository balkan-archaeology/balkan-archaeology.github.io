Despite many decades of research on anthropomorphic plastic of the
Neolithic and Chalcolithic in Southeastern Europe, their observable
find contexts inside the settlements received little attention so
far. Even if examples of figurines in seemingly special connections or
arrangements were published, it is meanwhile sure, that they are not
at all representing the whole picture. With the excavations of the
Chalcolithic (5th millennium BC) tell settlement “Măgura Gorgana” at
Pietrele (Romania), ongoing since 2002, and its surrounding flat
settlement, an outstanding possibility is given to change that
view. Almost 600 pieces of complete or fragmented anthropomorphic
figurines made of clay, bone, antler and marble were discovered until
now at this site and their find spots were precisely measured. The
number of these anthropomorphic representations and their contexts in
Pietrele provide an excellent picture of how common their appearance
was inside the settlement.  They were found in every house discovered
so far as well as in the space between the buildings.  Concerning the
clay figurines, the stratigraphical distribution enables to observe a
certain change of the spectrum of anthropomorphic representations from
a stereotype to more complex one. Bone figurines on the other hand
seem to be missing in the early settlement phases. There are
examinable differences between figurines of clay and bone, not only in
their shape, but also in the way they were treated before they were
deposited. By mapping different types of anthropomorphic items, the
cultural relations of the Chalcolithic tell settlements of the in the
Lower Danube Region can be shown as well as the sphere of the so
called Gumelniţa Culture. At the same time influences and possible
networks with other cultural circles between the Danube and the Balkan
Mountains and even to the northeast can be observed.
