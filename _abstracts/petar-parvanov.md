The presentation will discuss a particular group of deviant burials
registered in Bulgarian lands dating back to the Middle Ages. It is
argued that the face-down (prone) position cannot be the result of
taphonomyc post-depositional processes and is an intentional and
meaningful act. The known cases of prone burials from both individual
and mass grave contexts will be accounted for. Their analysis will
highlight any patterns of chronology, distribution etc. associated
with them. The record will be further examined against the known
archaeological evidence for deviant burials in European
perspective. Finally, potential interpretative framework will be
established.
