In the last few decades a small group of finds from the Early Bronze
age has been found. They have been interpreted as cult objects or clay
ritual altars. The aim of this study is to analyze these finds because
of the possibility some of them to be interpreted as clay vehicle
models. There is a significant amount of finds from neighboring
regions which are well known as clay vehicle models. The only group of
finds which can be connected with the mentioned artifacts is the
so-called clay models of wheels. They are not discussed in the
Bulgarian archaeological literature and they have never been subject
of a complete study. This work is the first attempt to supplement and
to analyze this group of finds during Early Bronze Age distributed in
Upper Thracian valley.
