The ring-shaped idols are considered as one of the most recognisable
artefacts from the Chalcolithic period. They appeared to be a
signature class of jewellery. The idols were manufactured in various
shapes and sizes in gold, silver, clay, bone, stone and etc. The
distribution of the Chalcolithic ring-idols forms an arch spread
across a wide geographical and cultural area. While ring-shaped idols
disappeared at the end of the 4th millennium BC in Southeastern
Europe, they survive in Anatolia and the Aegean world until the second
half of the 3rd millennium B.C.

The development of the ring-shaped idols in the Aegean and Anatolia is
well attested by the finds from the later excavations, researches and
the private collections. The most recent finds, dated in the Early
Bronze Age allows us to consider the metal ring-shaped idols as items
with supra-regional meaning. The importance of the 3rd millennium
B.C. finds provides a new opportunity to study the traditions, the
cultural interactions and the innovations in the ring-shaped idols
production. These finds allows us also to compare the rings and to
examine them as decorative objects, illustrating their functional use
and meaning.
