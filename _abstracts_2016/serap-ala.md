Aktopraklık is situated 25 km west of Bursa and located on one of the
eastern terraces of Lake Ulubat. Starting from 7th millenium's second
half, process can be traced uninterruptedly nearly one thousand years
of a period. At Aktopraklık Neolithic and Chalcolithic layers are
detected. Remnants of a settlement which is characterised with wattle
and daub buildings are dated to Early Chalcolithic Era, around
5800-5600 cal. BC.  Wattle and daub buildings, which were
distinguished by post holes could unearthed in a limited area. Our
knowledge about this phase's settlement plan is also limited but it's
known that these buildings were built without rubble
foundation. Pottery assemblage of this wattle and daub layer is known
not only from Northwest Anatolia but also from other regions in
Anatolia and Balkans. This presentation aims to contribute
understanding this time of period in Aktopraklık scale, by evaluating
and comparing pottery assemblage from wattle and daub layer according
to its material-technique and typological concept.
