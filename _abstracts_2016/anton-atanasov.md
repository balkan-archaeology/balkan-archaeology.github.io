The methods of the statistics are not truly traditional, but at the
same time not so innovative for the archaeological studies. They are
amongst a body of largely applied interdisciplinary approaches that
have been used in the processing of prehistoric finds, i.e. pottery
and flint, stone or bone tools. Moreover, a research of this kind
cannot be accepted as complete and really efficient unless it contains
such methodology.

The statistical investigation of the architecture requires the
formation of a huge in scope database. The process, however, is
hindered by many objective and subjective causes. A crucial issue is
the fact that most of the Copper age settlements are not fully dug and
only few of them are with completely excavated building
layers. Another reason is that even when the before-mentioned is not
at stake, the gathered information remains poorly published,
i.e. lacking stratigraphic sequence, descriptions, graphic and
photographic documentation, or even unpublished.  These factors impede
the differentiation of certain types of Chalcolithic dwellings and
their statistical processing.

This study utilises the statistical approach to analyse the
Chalcolithic architecture in Northeast Bulgaria, where most of the
settlement mounds have been excavated at a large size. The area
includes entirely dug mounds and fully exposed building layers –
Vinitsa, Golyamo Delchevo, Ovcharovo, Omurtag, Polyanitsa, Radingrad,
Ruse and Targovishte. They cover a significant chronological span –
from the beginning till the end of the Copper age, which gives the
chance to trace the characteristics and the development of the
building techniques, the shape, size and dimensions of the houses,
their inner plan and arrangement.
