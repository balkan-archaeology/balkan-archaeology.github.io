About the known from sources and from epigraphic monuments Thracian
king Rhoemetalces II, son of Rhascuporis, exist some uncertainty in
numismatic relation.

It is exacerbated by the fact that no fully published large hoard
exists and part of known speciments are associated either with king
Rhoemetalces I or king Rhoemetalces II.

My purposes are: to focus on coin emissions, which are made only from
bronze, in two nominals: both have similar inscriptions – av. –
ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΡΟΙΜΗΤΑΛΚΟV; - rv. - ΑΥΤΟΚΡΑΤΟΡΟΣ ΚΑΙΣΑΡΟΣ ΣΕΒΑΣΤΟV. On
revers always is head of roman emperor Tiberius, but the avers images
which have one or two busts and weight are the only differences
between nominals.; to submit comments on the different points of view
and to propose an actual opinion on the issue using and combine
information from unpublished deposits of king’s Rhoemetalces II coins,
sources, epigraphic data.

Rhoemetalces II ruled over Thrace till 37/8 AD and was succeeded by
Rhoemetalces III – son of Cotys and Antonia Tryphaena, the last king
of Thrace.
