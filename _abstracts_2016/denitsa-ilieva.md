In the later third millennium BC pottery production in Upper Thrace is
distinguished by high quality. The variety of shapes can be associated
with strict specialisation of functions of the vessels. Even types of
decoration are partly standardised for certain types of vessels. So
some of them are easily recognizable chronological indicators. For
example, the cups with high handles, known as type “Sv. Kirilovo” and
jugs with vertical handles, decorated with finger impressed plastic
band are typical of this period in the eastern part of Upper
Thrace. In the beginning of the second millennium BC ceramic changes
smoothly. Despite the similarities in decoration to those of the
previous period, most of the vessels are with altered proportions and
some new shapes appeared.

During the bronze age increases the production of pouring, drinking
vessels and containers for storaging liquids. Traditionally attention
focuses on the cups and jugs in which scholars look for signs of
change. Spouted vessels generally considered as liquid-related are
somehow neglected even though they are also widespread.

Vessels that have spouts are plates and bowls with incurved rims,
hemispherical deep bowls, jugs or pots with spherical body and
separated neck, the spout is usually in the upper part of the
body. Most of them have handles, usually in line with the spout. They
can be vertical or horizontal, sometimes are more then one. Spouted
vessels differ not only in form but also in decoration.

There are various ideas regarding their function. Some spouted vessels
are called teapots due to their similarity to the modern
type. However, one can only speculate whether the various types are
used for different liquids or for different stages of the preparation
of particular drink. Since most of them are found in settlements, they
are generally considered as vessels with utilitarian function but they
can easily be used for ritual purposes. Nevertheless, their specific
use can’t be denied and owing to their wide distribution they offer us
opportunity to make comparative analysis with other examples in wide
geographical areas.

This study aims at tracing the development of spouted vessels and to
determine whether there are chronological and regional differences
between them. Following the distribution of these vessels we can
assume their origin and prove that they can be considered as markers
for interregional interactions.
