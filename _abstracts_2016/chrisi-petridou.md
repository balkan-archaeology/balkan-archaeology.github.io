In this paper are presented the objectives and methods of the research
of plant food remains from seven sites in Bulgaria and Northern
Greece. The research is conducted in the broader context of the
PlantCult Research Project. The project seeks to explore the “culinary
cultures” of Prehistoric Europe and to reconstruct the culinary
practices involving plant ingredients through an interdisciplinary
approach. The main analytical tools are the macroscopic and
microscopic examination of the archaeological finds and experimental
replication, informed by ethnographic investigation.
