Dear colleagues,

The Department of Archaeology of Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski
and the National Institute of Archaeology with Museum of the Bulgarian
Academy of Sciences jointly organize an international doctoral student
conference. It will take place in Sofia, Bulgaria from **the 19th to
the 21st of November 2017**. The conference topic is **Balkan
Archaeology**.

Our goal is to facilitate working contacts between the youngest
researchers of Balkan past. Presentations will be grouped in three
sections: **Prehistory, Classical Archaeology, and Mediaeval
Archaeology**.

All doctoral students of archaeology working in this field are
welcome. **We recommend that participants discuss the subjects of
their presentations with their supervisors**. Presentation abstracts
(400–500 words) will be collected in advance and will be accessible
before the start of the conference. You can view the abstracts from
the previous edition on the [conference
website](/abstracts-2016/). The time allotted to each presentation
will be 20 minutes.

All reports will be collected approximately three months after the
conference to be published in the [Bulgarian e-Journal of
Archaeology](http://be-ja.org/).

The final day of the conference is intended for a sightseeing trip and
visits to museums.

The organizers will arrange accommodation for participants who are not
from Sofia.
