### From Sofia Airport

**By Metro**: From terminal 2, take the metro from the station just
outside the terminal and get off at station *Sofia University
St. Kliment Ohridski*. The university building should be directly
visible when you exit.

Metro tickets can be bought at the station for BGN 1.60.

**By Bus**: From terminal 1 or 2, take bus line 84 towards the city
center and get off at *Orlov Most*, just after the bus crosses the
bridge and turns left. Continue walking in the direction the bus came
from, passing the tall monument on your left side. You should see the
large university building on your right at the corner of the next
intersection.

Bus tickets can be bought from the driver with exact change and cost
BGN 1.60. They need to be perforated using the validation machines on
the bus.

Bear in mind that the bus travels considerably slower than the metro.
