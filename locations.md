### From Sofia Airport to Sofia University

**By Metro**: From terminal 2, take the metro just outside the
terminal (at ground level) and get off at station *Sofia University
St. Kliment Ohridski*. The large white building with green rooftops of
Sofia University is visible when you exit to street level.

Metro tickets can be bought at the station for BGN 1.60.

**By Bus**: From terminal 1 or 2, take bus line 84 towards the city
center and get off at *Orlov Most*, a large intersection with traffic
lights in the city center where the bus turns left and stops after
traveling along a divided highway for some time. Continue walking in
the direction of the divided highway the bus came from, passing the
tall monument on your left side. You will see the large white
university building with green rooftops on your right at the corner of
the next intersection.

Bus tickets can be bought from the driver with exact change and cost
BGN 1.60. They need to be punched (validated) using the small yellow,
orange or red, yellow box-shaped devices on the bus.

Bear in mind that the bus travels considerably slower than the metro
and can be subject to heavy traffic jams.

### From Central Train and Bus Station to Sofia University

Follow the signs from the train or bus station to the metro station
and take a train, direction city center. Get off at *Serdika* (the
stop after the next) and change to the other line, direction
*Mladost*, getting off at station *Sofia University St. Kliment
Ohridski* (the next stop). The large white building with green
rooftops of Sofia University is visible when you exit to street level.

Metro tickets can be bought at the station for BGN 1.60.

### City Transport

Bus, tram and trolley tickets can be bought from small vendors at most
stops or from the drivers and are validated using the punches (small
red, yellow or orange box-shaped devices) inside the vehicle. A
separate ticket is needed for every ride.
